# MDDP-Surrogate-Model-and-RL

This repository contains code and sample data to demonstrate the ability to predict small-scale incremental changes to deposited material geometry during the WAAM process.

# Usage

1. Download code and input files
2. Execute code in numerical order (e.g., 01_waam_surrogate_preprocessing, 02_waam_surrogate_model, 03_visualize, 04_waam_surrogate_rl)

Note that the first file performs data pre-processing, the second file creates the surrogate model, the third file provides visualization of surrogate model performance, and the final file demonstrates using the surrogate model in an RL framework.
